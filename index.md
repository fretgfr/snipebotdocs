SnipeBot is a Discord bot that allows you to "snipe" deleted messages, edited messages, and removed reactions. Deleted messages that had images and other attachments are also tracked.

"Snipes" are only held for a while, so make sure you snipe while you can!

## FAQ

### What is the prefix?

All user commands use Discord's slash commands system. All commands and some hidden commands can be accessed using the `~` prefix, however slash commands are the recommended way to interact with the bot.

### How do I change the prefix?

You cannot change the prefix of this bot.

### How long are "snipes" stored?

Snipes are stored for a short period after they are removed (currently between 10 and 20 minutes). This is subject to change.
